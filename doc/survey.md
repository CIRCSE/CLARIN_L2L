# A survey of the textual and lexical resources in CLARIN

In this document we list lexical and textual resources that can be used to build and improve an architecture of interoperable resourced based on lemmatization and the LOD paradigm. The resources included belong to two groups:
1. [lexical](#lod-compliant-lexical-resources) and [textual](#lod-compliant-textual-resources) resources that already adopt the LOD paradigm;
2. lexical and textual resources that, although not modeled using semantic web standards, can be used to extract the building blocks of our linked-data architecture (i.e. lemmas and corpus tokens). In their turn, these resources can be distinguished in two groups:
    a. [lexical](#lr-with-unique-ids-for-lemmas) and [textual]((#tokenized-textual-resources-selection)) data that provide unique identifier to lemmatized entries and tokens
    b. [lexical resources](#lemmatized-lists) that include lemma lists / [textual resoruces](#notes-on-other-textual-resources) in easily parsable formats (e.g. plain text) that can be tokenized and lemmatized.

Tim Berners-Lee proposed a [famous grading scheme](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) to classify data published on the web and assess its conformity to the LOD concepts based on a 5-star scale. While publishing data using a non-proprietary standard would earn your data 3 stars, 4 and 5 stars are reserved to those resources that use W3C open standars (like RDF) and to other datasets. In our survey, resources group under the point 1 would earn 4 to 5 stars, while the others would stop to 3. For our goal of establishing a LOD-based network of language resources based on lemmatization, however, we may assign the highest rank (5*) to the resources listed under point 1, the second place to the lemmatized and tokenized resources of pont 2.a (4*), and the third to the lemmatized lists and raw texts (3*).

CLARIN's resource families provide a huge help in identifying the relevant resources: in [this section](#resources-families) we provide a list of the most useful families that we draw information from. Whenever more updated version of a resource was availabel, however, we listed only the newest version. The Virtual Language Observatory ([VLO](https://vlo.clarin.eu/)) was another source of information.

**Nota bene**: we only listed resources available under an **open** license, but we interpreted the concept of "open" more broadly than it usually done: academic linceses and CC licenses with non-commercial restrictions are also accepted. However, the license must **not** exclude derivative works, as lemmatization and republishing in Linked Data do fall under the definition of "derivative". Also, only resources whose metadata were still accessibe, whose links were still working, and where a URL to download the content was explicitly listed were included in the survey.

## Lexical resources (LR)

These are the fundamental prerequsites for a lexical resources to be included in this inventory:
* it must be available for download under an "open" license (see [above](#a-survey-of-the-textual-and-lexical-resources-in-clarin) for a discussion);
* a **lemma** must be present, either as the label of the entries or as part of the analysis of word forms; token- or word lists without lemmatization are not considered;
* **part-of-speech** (POS) annotation must also be included.

### LOD-compliant Lexical Resources

This class, corresponding to our point 1 [above](#a-survey-of-the-textual-and-lexical-resources-in-clarin), includes the lexical resources (LR) that are distributed as LOD using an open standard of the W3C (RDF in particular).

These LRs can be both mined to extract LOD-compliant lemma lists and can be easily linked to other resources.

This type of resource represents the ideal format for interoperable language resources adopting the LOD paradigm to ensure interoperability. Vocabulary and ontologies used vary, but most of them rely on either the [Ontolex-Lemon](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/) model or the [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) RDF schema.

### LR with Unique IDs for lemmas
This class includes lexica, dictionaries, glossaries and word lists where the lexicographical content is grouped per lexical entry (LE, corresponding to the point 2.a [above](#a-survey-of-the-textual-and-lexical-resources-in-clarin)). These resources may consist of words and/or multi-word expressions (MEW), but not collocations extracted from corpora, as collocations are not necessarily part of the lexicon of a language; collocation dictionaries (where collocations are the main entries) are therefore not considered here.  

Although not all of them have IDs for entries, the lemmas can always be uniquely identified, as they are the structuring element of these resources. If data are distributed in tabular format, for instance, each row corresponds to a lemma, and therefore row numbers are enough to locate and indentify them. Although they are not modeled in RDF, many of them use other standards to structure the lexicographical information. The most commonly used are the Text Encoding Initiative [TEI](https://tei-c.org/), the Lexical Markup Framework ([LMF](https://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org) or - for the resources published by the [UFAL](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/) - the [PDT-Vallex](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt-vallex-valency-lexicon-linked-czech-corpora) format).

### Lemmatized lists
This class includes lists of inflected forms, synonym clusters, senses, derivational relations etc. that are connected in some ways to a lemma or a lemmatized lexical entry; they correspod to our class 2.b [above](#a-survey-of-the-textual-and-lexical-resources-in-clarin)). If the information is serialized in tabular format (e.g. in  CSV), the lemma is typically in one of the columns, repeated across several rows, while the row itself represents an inflected form, a sense or a derivational relation to another lemma. 

One example of this type of LRs is the form list used by the Czech morph analyzer [MorfFlex CZ 2.0](http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3186); here we report some lines with the 7 singular forms of the lemma *kočka* 'cat' (note that the lemma is in the first column):

```tsv
kočka NNFS1-----A---- kočka
kočka NNFS2-----A---- kočky
kočka NNFS3-----A---- kočce
kočka NNFS4-----A---- kočku
kočka NNFS5-----A---- kočko
kočka NNFS6-----A---- kočce
kočka NNFS7-----A---- kočkou
```

In such lists lemmas are not uniquely identifiable. They can be used as source materials to infer lemma lists (and, possibly, morphological lists). However, these LRs may still be helpful becuase: a) they do provide relevant information about a lemma (senses, forms etc.); b) they can still be mined to compile lemma lists.

Note that, whenever the information is retrievable and unless otherwhise noted in the `Notes` field, the **size** refer to the number of lexical entries (lemmas), not the items (e.g. the inflected forms) themselves.

## Textual resources

Textual resources can be classified according to similar criteria as the lexical ones. Corpus tokens, if lemmatized, can be linked to the same lemmas that are used to index entries in lexical resources. Tokenization, pos-tagging and lemmatization (with pos-tagging being used to disambiguate at least some homographic lemmas) are therefore the fundamental pre-processing steps needed to integrate texts into the architecture that we have in mind.

Several annotated resources (treebanks in particular) provide both tokenized and lemmatized texts. Many of these resources are included in the resource family for [Manually Annotated Corpora](https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families/manually-annotated-corpora); most of them are distributed in text-based formats such as the various CoNLL "dialects", or in XML.

### LOD-compliant textual resources

This class includes the handful of textual resources that are published as Open Linked Data. It must be noted that two out of 3 of them (the exception being the [N3 collection](https://hdl.handle.net/21.11129/0000-000D-FE95-D)) are not at the level of granularity of the token. Moreover, none of them includes lemmatization in the information provided as linked data.

In this case, thus, the "5-star grading" is somewhat misleading, as these LOD-resources still would need to undergo both tokenization (with the exception of the N3 collection) and lemmatization to be integrated in a LOD-based architecture as that that we have in mind.

### Tokenized textual resources (selection)

This class includes tokenized and annotated textual resources where the tokens can be uniquely identified and annotation is clearly attached to them (corresponding to the point 2.a [above](#a-survey-of-the-textual-and-lexical-resources-in-clarin)). Some of these resources (but not all) also include lemmatization as part of the information available for the tokens. Despite the fact that they are not published as linked data, these corpora represent the easiest resource to link to the architecture that we have in mind, especially if they include lemmatization.

### Notes on other textual resources

Raw or minimally annotated texts easily represent the most readily available resources in CLARIN as well as in any other repository. As our architecture is based on a pipeline including tokenization, pos-tagging and lemmatization, this type of content can be processed and integrated without any problem. 

Due to the abundance and ubiquity of materials distributed in this format, in our prototype of the [CLARIN's text linker](demo_overview.md) we chose to perform a selection and a screening of raw textual resources programmatically. Our tool scans the resources available in VLO, identifies the attached documents (and the contento of any compressed archved), filters the texts in all parsable formats (plain text or XML) and triggers the pipeline for pos-tagging, lemmatization and linking.

In our experiment on Italian, we identified `COMPLETE` resources that was parsed and analyzed. The full list is reported [here](). A subset of 14 resources is also included in the DB dump available at [`data/CLARINDB.sql.tar.gz`](../data/CLARINDB.sql.tar.gz).
